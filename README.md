"PoKeMoN Clicky Game" is a memory game that requires you to click on the PoKeMoN - but only once!  If you click on the same one twice, you lose.  Test your memory and be the greatest trainer that ever was!

### Prerequisites

You need to have a brain with working memory.

## Getting Started

Visit the deployed Charted link on Heroku at:
https://phoenixafterglow.github.io/clickity-click/ 

Simply click on the first PoKeMoN of your choice.  Keep clicking others that were not yet selected.  If you failed or reached a perfect 12/12, you can restart the game again by clicking the "Restart" button.

## Future Developments
We plan on adding more features including, but not limiting to, sound effects (sfx) based on win / lose and when the correct one is clicked.
